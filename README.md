# A comida na cantina Ã© boa?

Stupid web application that checks if the food at my university's canteens is good (opinionated).

Live at [http://cantina.surge.sh/](http://cantina.surge.sh/)

## JSONP

Cross-domain AJAX requests are forbidden in the browser by the [same-origin security policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy). The API offered by the university does not allow cross-origin requests via CORS, so I can't easily hit the API from the browser. I could have set up a reverse proxy to hit the API for me, but I didn't really want to have to maintain a server.

For the sake of keeping this running self-hosted for free, I resorted to JSONP which is a clever hack that basically wraps up a response in a callback function such that it forms valid JavaScript code. It then takes advantage of the fact that you can embed arbitrary cross-domain scripts in a page to execute the given callback function, which in essence is requesting the resource.

## Deployment

Ideally this would be hosted off of GitHub Pages, but their traffic runs over HTTPS and the API I'm using is still plain HTTP, which gave me all kinds of warnings in modern browsers, so I'm using [surge.sh](surge.sh) as an alternative.

```
$ surge
```
